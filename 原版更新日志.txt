    - Keter: permadeath and more aggressive SCPs (higher spawnrates and some
    of them chase the player more actively instead of wandering around randomly)
    - Custom: self explanatory
- A new room in the pocket dimension (replaces the room with the floating clouds of smoke)
- Some changes to the maintenance tunnel
- The SCPs that can "teleport" from waypoint to another (such as 173) can no longer
teleport to waypoints next to the player, so 173 shouldn't pop up from nowhere anymore

- Stairs are easier to climb up now
- Some optimization to the way NPCs are animated; FPS doesn't drop as drastically when
the MTF spawn anymore (although it still does drop quite a bit due to the jumble of 
spaghetti that is supposed to be their AI)

v1.0.6

- The props in the rooms (lamps, chairs, etc) aren't included in the actual room model

file size of the room models. The changes aren't implemented in all of the rooms yet,
so the effect isn't very significant yet

- Improved versions of the old door sounds
- The correct sounds are now played when opening/closing the large containment doors
- Random sound clips (distant gunfire, screams etc) are played for a short period
of time after the intro

- A small new room in the pocket dimension

the janitor in the endroom.
